        <h2>Description:</h2>
            <p>This is a really delicious tofu recipe based on one that you can find at <a href="https://www.noracooks.com/marinated-tofu/">Nora Cooks</a>.</p>
            <p>You can also put it in the air fryer, but I like the results I get from the oven a little bit better.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>16 ounces extra-firm tofu</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon pure maple syrup</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
                <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon fresh grated ginger, OR 1/2 teaspoon dried ginger</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Quick press the tofu: Cut the tofu into cubes. Place them evenly on a flat surface such as a cutting board lined with paper towels or a clean towel. Cover with a layer of paper towels, set a baking sheet on top and then something heavy, like a large book or cast iron skillet. Press like this for 15 minutes while you make the marinade. </li>
                <li>Make the marinade: In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, rice vinegar, maple syrup, sesame oil, garlic and ginger. </li>
                <li>Marinate the tofu: Place the pressed tofu pieces in a shallow dish. (In the photos above I doubled the recipe, so I used a 9 x 13 inch dish, but for one batch you will need a smaller dish, such as an 8 x 8 inch.) Pour the marinade over the tofu. Let it marinate for at least 1 hour, covered, in the refrigerator. If you want to leave it overnight, it will be even more flavorful.</li>
                <li>Heat the oven to 400 degrees and bake for 25-30 minutes until the tofu is at the desired crispiness.</li>
            </ol>
